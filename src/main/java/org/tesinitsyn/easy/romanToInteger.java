/**
 * Converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
 * <p>
 * Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.
 * The symbols and their corresponding values are as follows:
 * I: 1
 * V: 5
 * X: 10
 * L: 50
 * C: 100
 * D: 500
 * M: 1000
 * <p>
 * For example, the Roman numeral "II" is equivalent to the integer 2, which is obtained by adding two "I" symbols together.
 * The Roman numeral "XII" is equivalent to the integer 12, which is obtained by adding "X" and "II" together.
 * The Roman numeral "XXVII" is equivalent to the integer 27, which is obtained by adding "XX", "V", and "II" together.
 * <p>
 * Roman numerals are usually written from largest to smallest, from left to right. However, there are cases where
 * subtraction is used to represent certain numbers. The following are the instances where subtraction is used:
 * - "IV" represents 4, obtained by subtracting 1 from 5.
 * - "IX" represents 9, obtained by subtracting 1 from 10.
 * - "XL" represents 40, obtained by subtracting 10 from 50.
 * - "XC" represents 90, obtained by subtracting 10 from 100.
 * - "CD" represents 400, obtained by subtracting 100 from 500.
 * - "CM" represents 900, obtained by subtracting 100 from 1000.
